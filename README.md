## Playground repo for DART tests

### Goals:
* regression tests for models
* regression tests for converters
* unit tests for modules

* Utility scripts:
  - lint as much as possible

### Methods:
* Test anything protocol, bats & fortran\_test\_anything & tapview

### Reference cases:

Initally collecting reference cases in

/glade/work/hkershaw/GarbageCollection


### Ideas: 
* link developer tests to dartlib - currently a lot of duplicated compiling
